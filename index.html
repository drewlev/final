            Hi there! My name is Drew and I'm a senior in college with a passion for fintech and Python. As a finance major, I've always been interested in how technology is transforming the financial industry. That's why I decided to learn programming and develop my skills in Python, which is a popular language for data analysis and financial modeling.
            In my free time, I enjoy working on projects that combine my interests in finance and technology. For example, I recently built a Python program that uses machine learning algorithms to analyze stock market data and make predictions about future price movements. It was a challenging project, but I learned a lot and had a blast working on it.
            After graduation, I hope to pursue a career in fintech, where I can apply my knowledge of finance and programming to solve complex problems and drive innovation in the industry. I'm excited to see where this journey takes me, and I'm always eager to learn new things and explore new opportunities in the field.
